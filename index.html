		Wake up sheeple, they're feeding us people!!!!!
		and lies.
		<br>
		Ocean's dying, plankton's dying... it's people. *Soylent Green is made out of people.* They're making our food out of people. Next thing they'll be breeding us like cattle for food. You've gotta tell them. You've gotta tell them!
		<br>
		It’s so simple. All I have to do is divine from what I know of you. Are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet, or his enemy’s? Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I’m not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
		<br>
		Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. Yes — Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder’s origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
		<br>
		You’ve beaten my giant, which means you’re exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you’ve also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. 

		<br>
		and let me tell you this
		<br>
		Okay. Yes. We're bored. We're all bored now. But has it every occurred to you, Wally, that the process that creates this boredom that we see in the world now may very well be a self-perpetuating, unconscious form of brainwashing created by a world totalitarian government based on money? And that all of this is much more dangerous than one thinks. And it's not just a question of individual survival, Wally, but that somebody who's bored is asleep? And somebody who's asleep will not say "no"?
		<br>
		See, I keep meeting these people, I mean, uh, just a few days ago I met this man whom I greatly admire, he's a Swedish physicist, Gustav Björnstrand, and he told me that he no longer watches television, he doesn't read newspapers, and he doesn't read magazines. He's completely cut them out of his life because he really does feel that we're living in some kind of Orwellian nightmare now, and that everything that you hear now contributes to turning you into a robot.
		<br>
		And when I was at Findhorn, I met this extraordinary English tree expert who had devoted his life to saving trees. Just got back from Washington, lobbying to save the redwoods, he's 84 years old, and he always travels with a backpack cause he never knows where he's gonna be tomorrow. And when I met him at Findhorn, he said to me, "Where are you from?" and I said, "New York." He said, "Ah, New York. Yes, that's a very interesting place. Do you know a lot of New Yorkers who keep talking about the fact that they want to leave, but never do?" And I said, "Oh, yes." And he said, "Why do you think they don't leave?" I gave him different banal theories. He said, "Oh, I don't think it's that way at all."
		<br>
		He said, "I think that New York is the new model for the new concentration camp, where the camp has been built by the inmates themselves, and the inmates are the guards, and they have this pride in this thing they've built. They've built their own prison. And so they exist in a state of schizophrenia where they are both guards and prisoners, and as a result, they no longer have, having been lobotomized, the capacity to leave the prison they've made or to even see it as a prison." And then he went into his pocket, and he took out a seed for a tree and he said, "This is a pine tree." He put it in my hand and he said, "Escape before it's too late."
		<br>
		See, actually, for two or three years now, Chiquita and I have had this very unpleasant feeling that we really should get out. That we really should feel like Jews in Germany in the late thirties. Get out of here. Of course, the problem is where to go, cause it seems quite obvious that the whole world is going in the same direction. See, I think it's quite possible that the 1960s represented the last burst of the human being before he was extinguished and that this is the beginning of the rest of the future now, and that, from now on there'll simply be all these robots walking around, feeling nothing, thinking nothing. And there'll be nobody left almost to remind them that there once was a species called a human being, with feelings and thoughts, and that history and memory are right now being erased, and soon nobody will really remember that life existed on the planet.
		<br>
		Now, of course, Björnstrand feels that there's really almost no hope, and that we're probably going back to a very savage, lawless, terrifying period.

		According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
		Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
		The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
		Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
		Ooh, black and yellow!
		Let's shake it up a little.
		Barry! Breakfast is ready!
		Coming!
		Hang on a second.
		Hello?
		Barry?
		Adam?
		Can you believe this is happening?
		I can't.
		I'll pick you up.
		Looking sharp.
		Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
		Sorry. I'm excited.
		Here's the graduate.
		We're very proud of you, son.
		A perfect report card, all B's.
		Very proud.
		Ma! I got a thing going here.
		You got lint on your fuzz.
		Ow! That's me!
		Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
		Bye!
		Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
		Hey, Adam.
		Hey, Barry.
		Is that fuzz gel?
		A little. Special day, graduation.
		Never thought I'd make it.
		Three days grade school, three days high school.
		Those were awkward.
		Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
		You did come back different.
		Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
		Hear about Frankie?
		Yeah.
		You going to the funeral?
		No, I'm not going.
		Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
		Don't waste it on a squirrel.
		Such a hothead.
		I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
		I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
		That's why we don't need vacations.
		Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
		Well, Adam, today we are men.
		We are!
		Bee-men.
		Amen!
		Hallelujah!

		The Matrix is everywhere, it is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work, or when go to church or when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
		<br>
		That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, born inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind. Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself. This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. Remember -- all I am offering is the truth, nothing more.

		It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. 
		<br>
		The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran. 
		<br>
		Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended. 
		<br>
		Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered. 
		<br>
		Behind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live -- did live, from habit that became instinct -- in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. 
		<br>
		Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste -- this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible. 
		<br>
		The Ministry of Truth -- Minitrue, in Newspeak -- was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party: 
		<br>
		WAR IS PEACE 

		FREEDOM IS SLAVERY 

		IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH 
		<br>
		A way out west there was a fella, 
		fella I want to tell you about, fella 
		by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At 
		least, that was the handle his lovin' 
		parents gave him, but he never had 
		much use for it himself. This 
		Lebowski, he called himself the Dude. 
		Now, Dude, that's a name no one would 
		self-apply where I come from. But 
		then, there was a lot about the Dude 
		that didn't make a whole lot of sense 
		to me. And a lot about where he 
		lived, like- wise. But then again, 
		maybe that's why I found the place 
		s'durned innarestin'...
		<br>
		
		They call Los Angeles the City of 
		Angels. I didn't find it to be that 
		exactly, but I'll allow as there are 
		some nice folks there. 'Course, I 
		can't say I seen London, and I never 
		been to France, and I ain't never 
		seen no queen in her damn undies as 
		the fella says. But I'll tell you 
		what, after seeing Los Angeles and 
		thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
		wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' 
		bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any 
		a those other places, and in English 
		too, so I can die with a smile on my 
		face without feelin' like the good 
		Lord gypped me.
		<br>
		
		Now this story I'm about to unfold 
		took place back in the early nineties--
		just about the time of our conflict 
		with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies. I 
		only mention it 'cause some- times 
		there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 
		'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes 
		there's a man.
		<br>
		
		And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- 
		sometimes there's a man who, wal, 
		he's the man for his time'n place, 
		he fits right in there--and that's 
		the Dude, in Los Angeles.
		<br>
		
		...and even if he's a lazy man, and 
		the Dude was certainly that--quite 
		possibly the laziest in Los Angeles 
		County..which would place him high in the 
		runnin' for laziest worldwide--but 
		sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes 
		there's a man.

		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Well, I lost m'train of thought here. 
		But--aw hell, I done innerduced this enough.
